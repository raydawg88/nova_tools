### Hunter's Comment:
"I built RefundRadar after missing a $200 price drop on a laptop I had just bought. Turns out most major retailers have price protection policies but make them hard to use. RefundRadar makes it automatic - just add your purchases and we'll monitor prices for you. 

In testing, users saved an average of $487 in their first year. One user even got $1,400 back on appliances they bought during a 'sale' that wasn't really a sale.

We're 100% free and always will be for individual users. Would love your feedback!"
