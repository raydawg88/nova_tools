## Show HN: RefundRadar - Monitor purchases for price drops (nova-tools.netlify.app)

I built RefundRadar after discovering I could have saved $200 on a laptop purchase if I'd known about Best Buy's price protection policy.

Most major retailers (Amazon, Best Buy, Target, etc.) offer 14-90 day price protection but:
- They don't advertise it
- The process is intentionally difficult
- Most people don't track prices after buying

RefundRadar solves this by automatically monitoring your purchases and alerting you to claim refunds when prices drop.

Technical details:
- Pure client-side JavaScript (no backend, your data stays local)
- LocalStorage for persistence
- Simulated price checks in demo mode
- Planning to add browser extension for auto-import

Would love feedback from this community, especially on:
- Privacy approach (all client-side)
- Monetization ideas that don't compromise user trust
- Technical architecture for scaling
