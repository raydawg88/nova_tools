**Title:** I built a free tool that tracks your purchases for price drops - recovered $400 last month

**Post:**
Frustrated by missing price drops after buying something, I built RefundRadar. It monitors your purchases and alerts you when prices drop so you can claim refunds. Most stores have 14-90 day price protection but don't advertise it.

Just helped my mom get $180 back from Best Buy on a TV she bought 3 weeks ago. The tool is completely free and doesn't require any payment info.

Would love feedback from this community!

**Title:** Built a tool to find insurance overpayments - average person saves $1,400/year

**Post:**
After discovering I was overpaying by $2,100/year across my policies, I built PolicyRadar. It analyzes your current insurance (auto, home, life) and finds missing discounts + better rates.

No affiliation with any insurance company. Just shows you what discounts you're missing and what questions to ask your agent.

Free analysis, would appreciate feedback from this community.

**Title:** Built a tool with real salary data - tired of lowball offers

**Post:**
Got tired of going into negotiations blind, so I built SalaryScope. It's a crowdsourced salary database where people anonymously share real compensation data.

Already have data from 50+ companies. The more people contribute, the better it gets for everyone.

Completely anonymous, no signup required.

**Title:** Made a tool to cancel subscriptions instantly - save your money

**Post:**
Built CancelBot because I was tired of companies making it impossible to cancel. It generates professional cancellation emails in different tones (from polite to "Karen mode").

Also tracks all your subscriptions so you can see how much you're wasting each month.

Free to use. Stop letting companies steal your money.

**Title:** 75% of resumes get auto-rejected by ATS - I built a free tool to fix that

**Post:**
As someone who's been on both sides of hiring, I know most resumes never reach human eyes. Built ResumeBeam to help people optimize their resumes for ATS systems.

It shows exactly what keywords you're missing and how to fix formatting issues that cause auto-rejection.

Already helped 100+ people get past the ATS filters.
