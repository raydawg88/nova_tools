# How to Find Your Live Netlify URL

## Step 1: Go to your Netlify dashboard
https://app.netlify.com

## Step 2: Look for your site
You should see a site that says something like:
- "nova-tools" or 
- A random name like "amazing-forest-12345"

## Step 3: Click on the site

## Step 4: Find the URL
At the top, you'll see your live URL:
- Something like: https://amazing-nova-12345.netlify.app
- Or if you set a custom name: https://nova-tools.netlify.app

## Step 5: Copy and share that URL!

That's the URL where your products are live and what I need to start promoting them!

### Can't find it?
If you don't see any sites, the deployment might still be in progress. Look for:
- A "Deploys" tab showing build status
- Any error messages
- Or just wait 2-3 minutes and refresh
