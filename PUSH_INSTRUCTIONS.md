# Push Clean Code to nova_tools

Run this command:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted:
- Username: `raydawg88`
- Password: [Use your GitHub token - the one that starts with ghp_]

## After Pushing:

1. **Update Netlify**
   - Go to Netlify settings
   - Disconnect old repo
   - Connect new `nova_tools` repo
   - Site will redeploy automatically

2. **Security Going Forward**
   - Never commit API keys
   - Use environment variables in Netlify for any future API needs
   - Add sensitive files to .gitignore immediately

## Current Status:
- ✅ All API keys removed from code
- ✅ Clean git history (no trace of old keys)
- ✅ Ready to push
- ❌ Old exposed keys are revoked (good!)

The products themselves don't need API keys to function - they're all client-side JavaScript!
