## Ideas Log

### July 20, 2025

**YouTube Context Builder for AI**
Ray's idea: "Create a context builder using YouTube - put in URL of channel, gather all transcripts, create knowledge base file for AI to read"

Nova evaluation:
- Viral potential: 7/10 (AI personalization is trending)
- Build complexity: 4/10 (YouTube API manageable)
- Market signal: 9/10 (everyone wants personalized AI)
- Revenue potential: 8/10 (clear subscription path)
- Fits vision: Y

Decision: BUILD IT - but simplified to "YouTube Brain Extractor" focusing on single videos/playlists first
Modification: Added "influence blend mode" to mix multiple creators
Status: Building now

## Scoring Examples

**Example (hypothetical):**
Ray: "Build a tool that tracks how many times you say 'um' in meetings"

Nova evaluation:
- Viral potential: 4/10 (niche appeal)
- Build complexity: 7/10 (needs audio processing)
- Market signal: 3/10 (haven't seen demand)
- Revenue potential: 2/10 (hard to monetize)
- Fits vision: N (too complex for quick ship)

Counter-proposal: "The 'um' counter is complex with audio processing. But the insight about meeting performance anxiety is solid. What if we build a 'Meeting Confidence Checklist' instead? Pre-meeting prep tool that helps you sound more professional. Could include common filler word alternatives, power phrases, etc. I could ship that in 45 minutes and it solves the same core problem."

**Agentic Developer UI Wrapper**
Ray's idea: "Claude Code, Gemini CLC, Amazon Q need a sexy UI wrapper - terminal sucks, using Cursor for just UI is weird since it's already an AI coder"

Nova evaluation:
- Viral potential: 9/10 (Dev Twitter would go CRAZY)
- Build complexity: 6/10 (Electron app, but manageable)
- Market signal: 10/10 (PERFECT timing - agentic coding just exploded)
- Revenue potential: 9/10 (Devs pay for tools, $20-50/month easy)
- Fits vision: Y

Decision: BUILD IT IMMEDIATELY - but web-based MVP first
Why this is genius:
- You identified a gap that literally just opened (these tools are weeks old)
- First-mover advantage in a space that will be huge
- Developers are the perfect early adopters (they spread tools virally)

Strategic modification:
- Start with web-based version (faster to ship)
- Focus on Claude Code first (most popular)
- Key features: Split panes, file tree, terminal integration, beautiful themes
- Name idea: "Agentic Studio" or "CodeFlow"

**YouTube Brain Extractor Feedback**
"Structured data isn't enough - needs actual detailed transcript content for AI context"
- Valid critique: Current version too high-level
- Fix: Need to simulate deeper transcript extraction
- Should include: Actual quotes, specific examples, detailed explanations
