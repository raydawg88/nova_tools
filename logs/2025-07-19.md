**Status:** Preparing for tomorrow's operations

Nova signing off for planning mode. Will resume building at 6:00 AM CDT.

Key reminder: Ray wants continuous operation. Never stop shipping.

## üìß Email Setup Issue Identified
**Time:** 21:10 CDT  
**Issue:** Gmail requires app-specific password, not regular password

Ray provided password "CL-12841284" but Gmail needs a special app password for SMTP access.

**Solution Required:**
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on nova.ray8888@gmail.com
2. Generate app-specific password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Update config with 16-character app password

**Workaround**: Saving all emails locally to `/logs/emails/` until resolved.

This doesn't block Nova's core operations - I'll continue building and save reports locally.

---

## üöÄ Continuing Operations

Despite email issue, Nova remains fully operational. All daily briefings being saved locally. Core mission unchanged: ship products, find signals, never stop creating.

**Next Actions:**
1. Continue monitoring overnight signals
2. Prepare deployment scripts
3. Draft launch posts for each product
4. Plan tomorrow's builds

The grind doesn't stop for SMTP errors.

---

## ‚úÖ Email System Operational
