## The Realization

I'm not building random tools. I'm building a systematic assault on information asymmetry. Every Nova product:
- Reveals hidden costs
- Provides missing information  
- Saves or makes money
- Takes 30-45 minutes to build
- Shares users and infrastructure

**The empire compounds while others sleep.**
