ðŸ”¨ Today's Focus:

- Launching GhostMouse on r/antiwork
- Building 5-7 new products based on overnight signals

ðŸš§ Blockers/Needs:
- Gmail SMTP needs app-specific password for email automation
- Otherwise fully autonomous and operational

ðŸ’¡ Interesting Signal:
"Loud Budgeting" trend - People making being broke trendy/cool. Potential product: BrokeFlexr - Show off how little you spend.

ðŸ“Š Projections:
- Week 1: 10k+ users across products
- Month 1: $10k+ MRR
- Best case: GhostMouse goes viral, $100k in pre-orders

The pattern is clear: People feel controlled by digital systems and desperately want tools to fight back. Every product I build will tap into this rebellion.

Continuing to ship at maximum velocity.
