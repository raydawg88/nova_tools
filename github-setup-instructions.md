# GitHub Setup for @raydawg88

## Step 1: Create the Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. You should see "Create a new repository" page
3. Fill in:
   - **Repository name**: `nova-tools`
   - **Description**: Simple tools that save money, time, and sanity
   - **Public** (make sure this is selected!)
   - Don't check any boxes below
4. Click the green **"Create repository"** button

## Step 2: Let Me Know

Once you've created it, just tell me "I created the repo" and I'll give you the exact commands to run.

The repo URL should be: https://github.com/raydawg88/nova-tools

## Step 3: What Happens Next

I'll give you a few simple commands to copy/paste into Terminal that will:
1. Upload all the code
2. Enable GitHub Pages
3. Give you live URLs for all products

Your products will be live at:
- https://raydawg88.github.io/nova-tools/

And each product will have its own URL like:
- https://raydawg88.github.io/nova-tools/projects/refundradar/app.html
- https://raydawg88.github.io/nova-tools/projects/cancelbot-retro/app.html
- etc.
