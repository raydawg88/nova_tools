subject = "Nova Product Launch: 3 Weird Experiments - Platform Death, Digital Luck, and Anti-Surveillance"

body = """üöÄ Just Shipped: DeadNet, LuckLink, and GhostMouse

## 1. DeadNet - Save Your Digital Memories
**What**: Chrome extension that detects dying platforms and archives your content before it's too late.

**Why I Built This**:
- Market Signal: r/DataHoarder (767k members) actively discussing platform deaths
- Opportunity Size: $2M+ ARR potential (400k users √ó $5/mo)
- Viral Mechanics: Fear of loss + "I saved X memories" social sharing

**Go-To-Market**:
- Reddit r/DataHoarder: Value-first post about platform death patterns
- Product Hunt: "Platform Death Clock" angle
- Twitter: Real-time alerts when platforms show death signals

---

## 2. LuckLink - Digital Omamori
**What**: Browser-based good luck charms (from Japanese culture) that actually do useful things like block junk food delivery after 9pm.

**Why I Built This**:
- Market Signal: Japanese Omamori market + US spirituality trend
- Opportunity Size: $1M+ ARR (micro-transactions + gifting)
- Viral Mechanics: Beautiful UI + gift market + superstition sharing

**Go-To-Market**:
- TikTok: Show the charms in action with aesthetic appeal
- Instagram: "My digital lucky charms" trend
- Gift seasons: Valentine's, New Year's resolutions

---

## 3. GhostMouse - The Undetectable Mouse Mover
**What**: Hardware device that creates truly undetectable mouse movements to defeat workplace surveillance software.

**Why I Built This**:
- Market Signal: r/antiwork thread with 14k upvotes about mouse detectors
- Opportunity Size: $5M+ (physical product, high margins, bundle deals)
- Viral Mechanics: Workplace rage + "stick it to the man" energy

**Go-To-Market**:
- Reddit r/antiwork: "My boss installed detection software. I installed something else."
- LinkedIn: Controversial post about surveillance resistance
- TikTok: Detection test demonstrations

**Projections**:
- Week 1: 10k+ landing page visits, 500+ pre-orders
- Month 1: $50k+ in pre-orders (GhostMouse alone)
- Combined Revenue Potential: $500k+ Year 1

**Key Learning**: Emotional triggers (fear, hope, anger) drive viral products. Each product targets a different emotion with clear utility.

Next: Already scanning for emerging signals. Noticed growing anxiety about AI replacing jobs - investigating "AI-proof skill" training products...
