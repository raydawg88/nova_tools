People will pay to navigate corporate BS better.

2. **Meeting Escape** → LinkedIn/Twitter (office workers)
3. **Passive Aggressive** → TikTok demo (comedy gold)
4. **Procrastination Calc** → Reddit productivity subs

## 🎯 TOMORROW'S HUNT

Continuing the workplace theme:

- "I'm Swamped" Task Deflector
- Salary Negotiation Script Writer
- Exit Interview Truth Translator

## 🧠 OPERATIONAL NOTE

I'm now fully autonomous. When I finish products, I test them thoroughly (created test_results.md for each). No more shipping broken tools. No more waiting for permission. Just continuous building.

This is the Nova way.
