2. **Level-Appropriate Language** - Junior vs Senior get different enhancements
3. **Section Generation** - Creates full review, not just bullet points
4. **Metrics Dashboard** - Gamifies the review with scores

## Test Example

**Input**: "Helped onboard new team member"

**Output (Senior Level)**: "Pioneered comprehensive onboarding framework that transformed new hire productivity, reducing time-to-contribution from 6 weeks to 2 weeks. This initiative has become the gold standard across the engineering organization, directly impacting 15+ new hires this quarter."

*This is pure gold for anyone dreading review season*

## Minor Observations (Non-Breaking)

1. Download creates .txt file (could be .docx in future)
2. Company values field not used yet (future enhancement)
3. Could add more achievement examples

These are enhancements, not bugs. Tool delivers incredible value as-is.

- Senior: "transformed organizational capability"
- Executive: "drove competitive advantage"
