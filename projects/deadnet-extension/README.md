# DeadNet - Save Your Digital Memories

A Chrome extension that detects when you're browsing dying platforms and helps you archive your content before it's too late.

## Features

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`

## How It Works

DeadNet monitors platforms showing signs of decline:
- Mass user exodus
- Ownership changes
- API restrictions
- Financial troubles
- Pivot away from core users

When you visit an at-risk platform, DeadNet alerts you and offers to archive your content locally.

## Revenue Model

- **Free**: Archive up to 100 items per platform
- **Pro ($4.99/mo)**: Unlimited archiving + cloud backup
- **Team ($19.99/mo)**: Archive entire communities

## The Problem We Solve

Every year, millions of digital memories disappear when platforms die. Photos, posts, connections - gone forever. DeadNet ensures your digital legacy survives the platform that hosts it.
