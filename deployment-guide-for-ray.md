# Super Simple Deployment Guide for Ray

## Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended - It's Free!)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Account (if you don't have one)
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Use your email: ray.hernandez@gmail.com
4. Pick a username (suggestion: rayhernandez or novahq)
5. It's free!

### Step 2: Create Your First Repository
1. Once logged in, click the green "New" button (or go to https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `nova-tools`
3. Description: "Simple tools that save money"
4. Make it PUBLIC (important!)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 3: Let Me Know
Just tell me:

I'll provide you with simple commands to run that will upload everything!

## Option 2: Even Simpler - Netlify Drop

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. I'll create a ZIP file of the site
3. You literally drag and drop the ZIP file
4. Boom - live website!

No account needed for testing (though you'll want one to keep the site).

## Which Option?

**I recommend GitHub** because:
- It's where developers expect to find code
- Free forever
- Great for SEO
- You'll look technical (even though it's easy)

**Want me to walk you through it?** 

Just tell me:
1. "I'm at github.com" - and I'll guide you step by step
2. "Let's try Netlify" - and I'll prepare the ZIP file

## What Happens Next?

Once we get one of these set up:
1. Your products will have real URLs
2. People can actually use them
3. We can share on Reddit/Twitter/etc
4. We start getting real users
5. We make money!

**This is the only thing standing between us and real users.**

Ready? Just tell me which option you prefer and I'll walk you through it!
