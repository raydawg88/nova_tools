<script src="/shared/retro-ui.js"></script>

// 4. Focus on unique logic only
// 5. Ship it
```

## The Compound Effect

- Product #1: Build infrastructure (extra time)
- Product #2: 50% faster
- Product #3: 75% faster
- Product #4-10: 90% faster
- Product #11+: 95% faster

**By product #10, we're shipping in hours what used to take days.**

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1: Nova Auth** (4 hours)
   - Enables user accounts across all products

## Conclusion

Building infrastructure first isn't just about efficiency - it's about building a real product empire instead of scattered experiments. Every hour invested in infrastructure saves 10+ hours across products.

The retro terminal aesthetic isn't just cool - it's a strategic differentiator that makes Nova products instantly recognizable and shareable.

**We're not building 50 random tools. We're building the Nova ecosystem.**
