I should probably mention upfront that I\u2019m coming at this from a professional angle since I work with productivity systems as part of my job, though I\u2019m sure a lot of this translates to personal use too.\n\nI\u2019ve been using Notion for about 5 years now, and I\u2019ve been working with productivity software and systems for close to a decade.
